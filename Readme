The Readme details and lists how the Client-Server program needs to be run, and what role each file created has to fulfil.

                    --- How to run the Client-Server program ---

The program can be run in the order of the following commands:
    Make
    ./Server <Max clients>
    ./Client <Ip address> <Port number>

Once the connection between the server and client have been established, then you can make use of either commands:
    Join <nickname> <realname>
    Whois <nickname>
    Time
    Quit

After the program has been successfully compiled and run, its object files created can be deleted by running the following command:
    make clean

                            --- Files information ---

1. Makefile - This file is used to create and remove all object files, if no errors are found in the .c files.
Instead of each time, one by one call every file and compile it to be run for the program, Makefile makes it easier to compile all
files at once, and successfully launch the program.

2. server.c - This .c file contains code which is used for the creating of the server, sockets, connecting to the clients and successfully launching of the Client-Server program after the server has been initialised.

3. server.h - This header file contains the declarations for the functions used in server.c file.

4. client.c - This source file contains functions and commands that is used to create clients, sockets, and connections on the client side of the program.

5. range.h - This header file is used to create macros, whereby are substituted in the source files (server.c or client.c) each time they have been called.

6. text.c - Contains functionality for null terminator and overwriting output when running the Client-Server program.

7. text.h - Contains the declarations for the functions created in text.c file.
